Glencore has already conducted thorough research on the private reserve, confirming that no coal is present in the area. The private reserve is home to some of the oldest cycads, with trees dating from 800 to 1800 old, including the threatened Cycad Middelburgensis. The reserve is also home to iron age structures dated between AD 1600 to 1830. The beautiful reserve is also well known for its rock paintings depicting the early Ndebele and Sotho settlement in the area. Reserve owner, Sid Sidersky, says that heâ€™s received tremendous support against the planned prospecting with Glencore and the Endangered Wildlife Fund, registering as affected parties alongside others like Sean Badenhorst of Tread magazine. A petition, started by Presidentsrus resident, Mr Deon Johnson, is also circulating online, with signatories like the National Cycad Society.
