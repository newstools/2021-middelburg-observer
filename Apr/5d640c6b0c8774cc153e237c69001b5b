The ongoing taxi violence between two rival associations, resulting in a physical confrontation with police on Wednesday, has resulted in both associations losing their routes. MEC for Public Works, Roads and Transport, Ms Mohita Latchminarain, announced tonight that that operating licenses for both the Nasaret District Taxi Association and the Mhluzi District Taxi Association, will be revoked in seven days form the announcement, to quail ongoing violence. “After careful consideration, I consider the safety of passengers dependent on public transport, taxi drivers, taxi owners and people entering disputed areas, compromised by the ongoing violence,” MEC Latchminarain says. The MEC’s constituency is Middelburg. The Hon. MEC says to ensure safety, the routes must be closed. The department has exhausted all avenues to reach a compromise between the rival associations. The MEC has legal authority to suspend the licenses of both associations to ensure public safety. The MEC has apologized for the inconvenience on commuters, but say “their safety is paramount”. A few weeks ago, R5 assault rifles were utilized to shoot at taxis and commuters at the Midwater rank. The fate of the routes is now in the hands of commuters and operators, owners and drivers who have mostly armed themselves against further assaults from rival associations. A taxi driver told www.mobserver.co.za “shoot first, stay alive”. Members of the public can make submission within the next seven days as to why the routes and licenses should not be suspended with immediate effect. Submissions can be directed to communicationdpwrt@mpg.gov.za.
