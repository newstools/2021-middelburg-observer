Reports were received early this morning that the entrances to both the mall and the mine was closed by protest action. Www.mobserver.co.zaÂ paid a visit to the scene at the Middelburg Mall where a group of unemployed residents had gathered to follow up with mall management on a memorandum that was handed over two weeks ago. A strong presence of police and reaction officers has defused the situation and the mall is open to customers.
