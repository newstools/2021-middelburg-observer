Whiddleh Komapa and Zuko Mhloli made their first court appearance last Friday. Middelburg Police Spokesperson Captain Khanyisile Zwane said the teachers were arrested and charged with assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, malicious damage to property and common robbery. They allegedly assaulted another staff member. They will make their second court appearance on May 6. • Chaos at the school started two weeks ago when parents demanded the removal of the school’s embattled principal, Ms Duduzile Lusenga. The principal is being accused of mismanaging school funds and unilaterally hiring and firing educators.
