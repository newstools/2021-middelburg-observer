Chaos erupted again at Mhkulu Combined School on Tuesday morning when police and Department of Education officials were called to the school. Teachers and learners were surprised to find the school gates locked this morning with a chain and padlock. The school’s caretaker told the police and education officials that a teacher had demanded the school keys at about 05:00.  After many parents sat waiting outside the school for almost two hours, one parent decided to use bolt cutters to cut through the chains to gain access. Learners danced and sang with joy as the school gates opened. One of the educators escorted the police to the home of the teacher who allegedly took the school keys, but the police were unable to find them.  • Last Thursday, parents demanded the removal of the school’s embattled principal, Ms Duduzile Lusenga. Police had to fire rubber bullets and use pepper spray to disperse the protesting group of parents and students. Principal Lusenga was ordered to leave the school premises for her safety, she is being accused of mismanaging school funds and unilaterally hiring and firing educators.
