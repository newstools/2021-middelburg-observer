The owner believes to be the victim of remote jammers who targeted him upon his arrival at the clinic. He says he remained in the clinic for over an hour to collect medicine, before realizing his bakkie had been stolen. A BOLO was immediately issued for the bakkie which was spotted driving towards Mbombela by members of the Mpumalanga WhatsApp Crime Channel. The owner of the bakkie says he locked his bakkie with a hand held remote before entering the clinic. He believes his lock-signal was interrupted by another remote.  The bakkie has a canopy and its registration number is HJN761MP. People with information on the bakkie or the thieves can contact 082 761 6186 or 074 857 4992. â€¢ The bakkie of a Polokwane advocate visiting the Middelburg Magistrates Court was also stolen outside the courthouse last Tuesday. Advocate JP Morton was notified of the theft by Netstar Tracking while he was busy in court. The bakkie was later tracked to Daveyton near Benoni where it was recovered.
