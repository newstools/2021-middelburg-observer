The former Middelburg estate agent was hunted down by the Middelburg Hawks Serious Commercial Crime Investigating Unit for alleged fraud. According to a media statement by the Hawks, van Staden was arrested on Monday, in Boksburg, after members of the public supplied information that led to her arrest. Following a tip off, the Hawks managed to apprehend her from a residence, where she was already packed and ready to flee. The media statement further said that van Staden was arrested in Protea Glen, Soweto in August 2019 for fraud where after she was released on bail. The matter was postponed to 11 November 2020 but she evaded court. Consequently, a warrant of arrest was issued against her. A further investigation linked her with other cases of fraud worth a total value of approximately R184 000. These cases are in Orange Farm, Nelspruit, Lydenburg and Piet Retief, where more than 36 potential witnesses laid complaints against her. Van Staden will appear in court today where the case will likely be postponed for further investigation and possible Â bail application, which the state will oppose due to her being a flight risk. This is a developing story and updates will follow.
