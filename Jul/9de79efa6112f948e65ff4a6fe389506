Www.mobserver.co.za is being inundated by calls from concerned citizens who are saying that accounts are spreading of looting at Wonderpark Spar. These rumours are false and all is calm. A manager at Wonderpark Spar has just confirmed that they are open and safe. He added that there is a Wonderpark Shopping Complex in Pretoria and suspects that people are confusing the two. Www.mobserver.co.za will immediately inform residents should any protest action surface in Middelburg and surrounds.    Do you have a news lead?
