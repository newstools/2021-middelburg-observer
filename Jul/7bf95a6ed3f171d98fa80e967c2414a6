Mr Viljoen called www.mobserver.co.za, today (Friday morning), asking to make a public warning to residents, after noting that people continue to disregard regulations and put themselves and others at risk. He said that as Hospital Manager, who is in contact with the entire network of the Life Group, he currently does not know of a single hospital that has any beds or ventilators available for critical patients. “This wave is no joke, the hospitals are full and the virus doesn’t ask you your age.” When asked which Covid-19 variant has taken hold of the community, Mr Viljoen said that he is unsure. “We suspect that we’re dealing with the highly contagious variant as seen in India. It is time for people to hide.” He further reminded residents that they as a hospital will continue to go beyond expectations to help patients but begs the public to act responsibly and avoid transmissions.
