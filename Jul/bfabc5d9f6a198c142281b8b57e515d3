According to the police report, the 17-year-old victim was on her way home at about 10:00 when she noticed an acquaintance inside a nearby car. The acquaintance invited her to accompany him, and two other men, to Newtown. On their way back, they decided to go to Tokologo. The driver dropped off his friends, including the acquaintance, and was left alone with the victim. The man reportedly undressed and demanded the 17-year-old to do the same. The victim refused, but the suspect forcefully undressed her, then raped her. She managed to push the suspect away and ran for help. Mhluzi Police spokesperson Sgt Thabitha Malehase said no arrests have been made yet.     Do you have a news lead?
