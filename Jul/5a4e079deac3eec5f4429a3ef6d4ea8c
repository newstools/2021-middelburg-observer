Apart from damaging the roads, they often park wherever they want, particularly in Meyer- and Cowen Ntuli Streets. Residents complain that the stationary trucks often draw prostitutes and drug dealers to the areas. The municipality however says that the drivers have told them they they only stop for food or a quick rest and then move on. Last Friday a truck, caught on security camera, damaged a traffic light at the Beyers Naude- and Meyer Street intersection. It is the second time that the specific traffic light had to be replaced at taxpayer’s cost. There’s only two truck stops, Fuel Solution and Cool Ideas, in Middelburg and both are situated outside town next to the N4. • Get your copy of this week’s Middelburg Observer for a full report.
