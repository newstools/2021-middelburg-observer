The fire started this morning, at number 5 Tokomanie Complex, in Samora Machel Street. The lady who resides in number 5, sustained burn wounds during the fire and was assisted by Gunmar Ambulance Services at the scene. The Middelburg SPCA also rushed to the scene, to help rescue the dogs from the inferno. It is reliably assumed that the fire was caused by an explosion of a gas bottle, after one of the residents heard a bang. The fire brigade was at the scene to douse the fire.
