A three month old baby was murdered in the Avontuur area in the early hours today. According to the police a woman handed herself over to the police after the baby was killed. Apparently the woman, who had a three month old baby with her, took a lift from Doornkop to the Avontuur area (just past Kranspoort). When she arrived at the house where her boyfriend is staying, she knocked on the door and no one answered. The woman then allegedly screamed that if he does not open, she is going to kill the baby. The police report further states that she then threw the baby on the floor several times until the baby died. When the police arrived on the scene, she handed herself over to them.
