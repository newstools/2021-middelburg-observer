The body was lying in the field, in Nelspruitâ€™s direction. A pedestrian found the body. At first it was thought that her death was due to a hit and run, but she was not hit by a car. She was lying on her back and her shoes were removed. An inquest was opened by the police, which is an indication that she might have been murdered.
