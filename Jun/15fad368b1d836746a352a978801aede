The incident occurred this evening, Thursday 24 June 2021, at Bethal. According to police spokesperson brig. Leonard Hlathi, police were notified of an incident in which a woman was assaulted and shot by her husband. Upon arrival at the scene, the victim was found with a gunshot wound and lying in a pool of blood, still bleeding profusely. She was certified dead by paramedics and her husband was arrested on the scene. The woman was employed as a constable, stationed at Mzinoni Police Station, and she was apparently off duty when she was killed. The husband is also a member of the police holding the rank of sergeant, stationed at Hendrina Police Station. The suspect is expected to appear before the Bethal Magistrate’s Court on Monday, 28 June 2021, on a charge of murder. The two are said to have had a heated argument earlier and the suspect allegedly hit the victim as well as fatally shooting her. The Acting Provincial Commissioner of the police in Mpumalanga, Major General Thulani Phahla, has strongly condemned the incident and called on police members to seek professional help when faced with domestic challenges rather than resorting to resolve depressing issues with their guns. “It is unfortunate that our member has lost her life in such a manner, allegedly at the hands of a person who was supposed to have protected her. A double blow is that the suspect comes from within our ranks. “The police has systems in place such as the Health and Wellness System to deal with the well-being of members and I therefore urge members to effectively make use of these services, ” concluded General Phahla.
