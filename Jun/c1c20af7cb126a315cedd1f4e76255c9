Traffic is obstructed as queues of vehicles line up in the streets for the applications. Buyers must fit the list of qualifying criteria, and if they don’t, they are automatically disqualified. Applicants must be a natural South African citizen of 18-years and above. They must be able to pay cash only and undertake to use the property for residential purposes only. Only one stand will be sold per applicant, including married couples. Altogether 40% of stands are ringfenced for Black, Coloured and Indian procurement, who have been living in Middelburg for at least 36 months. A total of 691 properties varying in sizes from 350m² to 900m² are available. Qualifying buyers meeting the criteria will be entered into a raffle to ensure fairness. The date and time of the raffle will only be announced once the qualification process has been finalised.
