Annica van Staden and Fotoboy Makua are accused of money laundering and fraud. Makua is already out on bail. Van Staden was supposed to appear for bail application on Thursday, but she was not brought to court. She was supposed to appear in the Middelburg Magistrate’s court to apply for bail, but due to her not being present, the matter has now been postponed until next week. Van Staden appeared in the Lydenburg Magistrate’s Court earlier this week where she faces unrelated charges. She did not proceed with her planned bail application and the matter in Lydenburg has been postponed until July for further investigation.
