When school came out, pupils joined the sangomas in support of the suspended learners. Unathi Myeni told www.mobserver.co.za that two sangoma initiates were suspended from the school for undergoing training. The two grade nine learners were reportedly suspended two weeks ago. Mr Myeni is accusing the school of discriminating against the learners because of their beliefs. “These learners don’t disturb classes, they wear their sangoma attire underneath their school uniform. Everyone has a right to freedom of association in South Africa,” Mr Myeni said. He claims that other schools in Mhluzi allow learners to attend school when undergoing sangoma training and that an SGB member at Sozama insulted the sangomas and the two learners. “This is not the first time learners have been suspended for undergoing training,” he added. The Mpumalanga Department of Education spokesperson Jasper Zwane said his department will look into the complaint. Watch a video of the protest here:
