For two female victims of serious and violent crimes, these events will be nothing but smoke and mirrors, with the ones that left them feeling betrayed, most probably standing in the celebratory ranks handing out flyers about how women’s rights and lives matter. • Silindile Rachel Magola’s body was found lying next to the N4 just under a month ago. Although the post mortem report stating the cause of death has not yet been made public, she had wounds indicating she was assaulted before her death. Family members reported to police that a man threatened to kill and dump her next to the road a week before her death. Up to date, no one has been arrested. • Lauren Myuswa claims that she was raped for hours by a man wielding a gun. She eventually managed to alert a housemate who called the police. A man was arrested in her room and a gun was found in his car. Just over a week after his arrest, she was alerted via SMS that the case against him had been withdrawn due to a lack of evidence. Something that left her stunned. She says she has witnesses and she underwent a medical exam at hospital and DNA evidence was collected. Sadly the situation seems the same when it comes to media enquiries. The matter was discussed with Provincial Police spokesperson Brig. Leonard Hlathi, who promised to find out what happened and give feedback. A week later, Brig. Hlathi has not again answered his phone and reads, but does not respond to, WhatsApp messages. In the absence of a reasonable explanation, the rape victim, family of the murdered victim, as well as the greater public, are being left to draw their own conclusions.
