The family is situated on a smallholding along the R555 (old Witbank road) in the same vicinity as the old Drive-in theatre. The missing Husky is a two-year-old male, with blue eyes, and a white and light-brown colour. He responds to the name Skye. His owner, Alida, explained that he has been missing since 13 November. He was strolling along the Olifants River banks after someone shot at him and some other dogs. The carcasses of the other dogs were discovered in the river, but Skye was not found and Alida suspects that he managed to flee the shooter. Anyone with information on his whereabouts can contact Alida on 083 261 7200.
