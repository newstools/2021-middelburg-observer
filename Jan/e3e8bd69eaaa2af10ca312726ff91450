The suspect, 39 year-old Bhekani Mbuyisa, entered the community service centre in the early hours of the morning and allegedly started arguing with the officers on duty about the Covid-19 regulations. According to a statement by the Provincial Commisioner, Lieutenant Mondli Zuma, Mbuyisa became more aggressive and allegedly attacked Sergeant Jan Visser with the fists before stomping on the Sergeant when he fell over. The other officers on duty finally managed to restrain Mbuyisa. Sgt. Visser sustained a fracture to his right ankle as well as injuries to his nose and mouth. Mbuyisa was arrested and appeared in court on 6 January for a formal bail application.
