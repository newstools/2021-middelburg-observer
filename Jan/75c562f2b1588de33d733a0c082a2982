Andre van Wyk, from Roseleigh Funeral Home, said they are working around the clock to prepare bodies for funerals.
Mr Van Wyk also said they have seen a spike in the mortality rate from Covid-19 in the present second wave. While other provinces reported a shortage of coffins, Mr Van Wyk said he has not experienced a shortage at all. The Mpumalanga Health Department has identified the Steve Tshwete Local Municipality as a hotspot, at least 4 521 positive cases have been reported, while 67 people have succumbed to Covid-19. Funeral parlours and mortuaries are not the only ones feeling the strain of the pandemic. Middelburg Provincial Hospital and Life Midmed Hospital have reported a sharp increase in Covid-19 numbers, saying that the second wave of infections is far worse than the first. Helani Nel, from Life Midmed, said that the hospital has three Covid-19 wards now and all of them are filled to the brim.
