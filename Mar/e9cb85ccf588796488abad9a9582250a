They were ordered to disperse by heavily armed police officers who followed the unruly group back to the college where they planned to continue with the protest. Last week, students affected by unpaid NSFAS study funds, wreaked havoc by overturning dustbins and setting foliage alight. Police were ready since early this morning to avoid a repeat of last week’s vandalism. A group of around 100 college students engaged with public order policemen who told them that they were not allowed to roam around while protesting. They were ordered to return to the college where protests continued peacefully under the watchful eye of the SAPS.     Do you have a news lead?
