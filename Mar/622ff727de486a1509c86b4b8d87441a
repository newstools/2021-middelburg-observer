Assault rifles, including R5â€™s were used to shoot at stationery taxis as well as other vehicles. One taxi was shot through the radiator. Eyewitnesses account that some of the shooters jumped out of their vehicles to pick up shell casings at the scene before moving along in the mall, Nasaret and Extension 24 direction with police in pursuit. Members of the SAPS and Public Order Policing are at the scene and emergency services are on standby. The reason for unrest is unclear but it is suspected that the war is about the Nasaret and Ext. 24 route. Motorists are urged to be vigilant and avoid the mall, Nasaret and Ext. 24 areas.
