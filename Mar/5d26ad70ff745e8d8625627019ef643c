According to Daller journalist, Janine Saayman, who visited the scene, authorities were alerted by a civilian, and a search ensued along the banks of the Olifants River. The body of a fairly large man wearing a Transnet shirt was found with a gun shot wound to his head. Due to the state of decomposition, any identifiable traits cannot be determined.
