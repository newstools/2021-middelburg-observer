The crowd has dispersed and the road is open again. Police members pleaded with the drivers to go back to their taxi stands as they were blocking the road to essential services like Life Midmed Hospital and the police station. After a brief exchange with the drivers who demand protection against ongoing violence, police agreed to meet with them at their taxi stands to discuss a way forward. The road blockade comes on the back of at least five shooting incidents at the Midwater taxi stand on Tuesday afternoon during which live R5 rounds were fired at NDTA drivers and commuters. A gardening service told www.mobserver.co.za that a passenger in a taxi stole a gardening fork while they were busy at KFC on the corner of John Magagula and Cowen Ntuli Street.
