The matter will appear in the Mpumalanga High Court sitting in Middelburg on October 4. Thokozani Msibi (traditionally healer), Knowledge Mhlanga and Brilliant Mkhize are facing charges of housebreaking, murder, kidnapping and violation of a corpse. They allegedly killed Gabisile Shabane who was living with albinism and her cousin, Nkosikhone Ngwenya. Due to Msibi terminating the services of his legal aid lawyers the case was postponed twice. Judge Heinrich Brauckmann told Mr Msibi that if he decides to terminate the services of his current legal aid lawyer, Musa Mavasa, he will have to represent himself. “The victim’s families need justice and justice delayed is justice denied,“ said Judge Brauckmann. Judge Brauckmann said the court will no longer postpone the case. • One of the co-accused Themba Thubane, pleaded guilty in 2019 and is now serving two life sentences.    Do you have a news lead?
