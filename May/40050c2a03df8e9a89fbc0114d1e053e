Convicted murderer, Elliot Groenewald (63) who is currently serving a life sentence, was sentenced on Tuesday to an effective three additional years, concurrent to his life sentence, for having a cell phone in his cell, with which he plotted another murder. The target of the murder plot however declined to give testimony, resulting in Groenewald being sentenced on a lesser charge of intimidation. The conspiracy was reported to the Hawksâ€™ Serious Organised Crime Investigation team, resulting in the charges. The Court sentenced Groenewald to eight years imprisonment, of which five years is suspended for five years. The three year jail term will be served concurrent to the life sentence. Groenewald is family of Hettie Laas (49), with whom he allegedly conspired to have her husband killed. Laas was also charged.
