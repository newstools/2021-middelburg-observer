The video currently circulating on social media has scored thousands of views, showing how a magnet sticks to the arm of people who allegedly received the vaccine. The notion behind the video suggests that microchips are being implanted into recipients of the vaccine, and that the magnet sticks to the microchip’s hardware. Despite these hoaxes already being debunked worldwide, www.mobserver.co.za decided to test the theory ourselves, with the help of Mr Sal Botha. Mr Botha is one of the citizens over 60, who received his vaccine at the Middelburg Provincial Hospital. The video evidently shows that the magnet does not stick to his arm. Residents are urged to refrain from spreading false information surrounding Covid-19 as well as the vaccine itself.
