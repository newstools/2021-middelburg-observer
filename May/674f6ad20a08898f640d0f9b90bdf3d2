Minister Mbalula announced an extension of the amnesty period for drivers whose licenses expired between 26 March 2020 to 31 December 2020. Drivers whose licenses expired after 31 December 2020 do not have amnesty until August to renew their licenses. The amnesty temporarily extends the validity of all learners’ licenses, driving license cards, temporary driving licenses and professional driving permits. The amnesty does not include vehicle license discs, for which amnesty was granted until the end of August 2020, after which the country moved into soft lockdown, with all municipal services resuming. Residents whose vehicle license discs expired after August 2020 can expect normal late penalties. “Our license department is fully operational and there’s no excuse for motorists to plead ignorance,” municipal spokeswoman Ms Prudence Magutle told www.mobserver.co.za. She says “it’s advisable to renew vehicle license discs before they expire, to avoid penalties”. She says the department is addressing the lockdown backlog but that the amnesty remains applicable to all drivers affected during the lockdown.
