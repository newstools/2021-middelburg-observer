Following a nationwide spike in Covid cases, several institutions had to halt their services locally, including the AGS Lighuis Gemeente stopping services and HTS Middelburg closing for a week. Mr Viljoen said that although conditions in Gauteng and the Freestate have intensified, the situation looks stable at Life Midmed. “We have received several patients, but it still does not compare to the second wave. We urge residents to stay safe and healthy because we do not want to see critical Covid-19 patients.”
