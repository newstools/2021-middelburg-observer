Residents are still curious to know what caused the extreme bang, Friday two weeks ago, that was felt as far as 54km from out of town. After www.mobserver.co.za initially reported on the bang, residents from Mhluzi shared photos of blasting taking place in Mhluzi, for the development of a new substation. The blasting was done over the same time period when the impact was felt.

Roads were closed and residents were notified, and only people in nearby areas would have felt the impact. STLM could also not verify what caused the explosion.
