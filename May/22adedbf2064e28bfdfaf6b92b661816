The teams, assisted by Bidvest and Omega Security, were on their way to a meeting point, purposely to parade about suspects who were stealing tower batteries around Phola. While the team was on their way to the meeting point, they saw a white Isuzu bakkie driving from the network tower and they tried to stop it. The driver accelerated and a high-speed chase ensued. The suspects were cornered and forced to stop. The vehicle was searched and three occupants were found in possession of stolen tower batteries and Telkom copper cables valued to R125 000.00. The suspects will appear before the Phola Magistrateâ€™s Court on Tuesday, 18 May.
