However motorists are cautioned to be vigilant in all the areas within the province as criminals are eager to carry out this bad deed on a daily basis. The modus operandi of the suspects is, they place objects on the road such as tyre spikes, slabs, bricks, as well as large rocks covered in a plastic to trap motorists. These incidents usually occur late in the evening or early hours of the morning. Once motorists drive over these objects, their tyres get punctured or their vehicles damaged in the process, so they are forced to stop and inspect their vehicles. While doing so, the suspects then violently approach and rob them of valuables, such as cellphones, laptops, clothing items, cameras, firearms, jewelry as well as sums of cash amongst others. It has also been established that in most of these cases, the suspects are normally armed with firearms. Major General Phahla  has urged motorists to be wary of these trends and be vigilant on the road. “I strongly appeal that motorists should be vigilant when on the road, particularly when driving in the evening or early in the morning as that is when they (motorists) are targeted,” said the General Phahla. General Phahla also urged the public to try and limit late night driving but to plan their journey during the day. He indicated further that if driving during the night, rather limit the speed to gain a clear view of the road.
