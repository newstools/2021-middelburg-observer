The by-election for the soul of Mountain View, Chromeville and Rockville has been called by the IEC, following the passing of ANC councillor Patrick Motau on February 13 due to Covid-19 complications. According to the latest IEC statistics, the ward has 3 646 registered voters, with 183 new voters added since the last local government elections. In August, the ward will come up for grabs again when Middelburg residents head to the polls for the 2021 municipal poll. On Tuesday, between 08:00 and 17:00, IEC officials will be out to oversee special voting, while voting stations at Mphanama High School, Manyano Primary School and the Chromeville Community Hall will ready themselves for Wednesday’s official voting day. Registered voters can cast their ballots from 07:00 to 17:00 at the abovementioned voting stations, after which counting will commence. ANC candidate Mr Casious Sihle Mashiloane will go head-to-head with newly formed Middelburg and Hendrina Residents Front (MHRF) candidate Mr Jomo Segage and Lerato Pearl Mapengu from the EFF. Both the DA and FF+ has bowed out of the race. If the MHRF secures a win, it will be the front’s first council seat, which will be detrimental to the ANC but favourable for the opposition, with the DA maintaining its official opposition status. • Results will be published on www.mobserver.co.za.
