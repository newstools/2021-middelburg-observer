This comes after a volatile, two-hour-long meeting held by the Mpumalanga Department of Public Works, Roads and Transport on Friday(today). The two associations signed a memorandum of understanding after robust arguments about the Extension 24 and Rockdale routes. The associations agreed to find a long lasting solution about the disputed routes. In the meanwhile they will both operate in the area for 21 days while the department conducts investigations. NDTA questioned the department for giving MDTA a permit to operate in Extension 24 and Rockdale. Some of the NDTA members told the department officials that MDTA members must operate at their own risk in the area. After two hours of butting heads the two associations agreed to operate according to their operating licenses. If they fail to do so their operating licenses will be revoked and their vehicles will face being impounded. The agreement also stated that the private security company NDTA hired will not interfere in the disputed routes. The associations also agreed to participate in a meditation process facilitated by a senior council to resolve the disputes.
