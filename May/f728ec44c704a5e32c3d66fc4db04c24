Mr Alkant’s body was discovered last Tuesday by two Nkangala TVET College students who were using the free Wi-Fi in the area. His mother told www.mobserver.co.za that her son had “gastric issues” and was admitted at the Middelburg Provincial Hospital the day before he passed away. Mr Alkant discharged himself from the hospital and went into the open field near the cricket arena. A www.mobserver.co.za journalist identified Mr Alkant as the same person who asked motorists for a lift at the Middelburg Provincial Hospital on Monday morning, “He was asking motorists for a lift, but I immediately realised he was not well,” the journalist says.

He was found in just a t-shirt with the bottom half of his body exposed. A large pile of clothing were found near his body and an inquest docket was opened by the Middelburg Police. The deceased’s mother said her son was a loving and funny person. “He was the family comedian, everyone around him always laughed when he was around,” said the distressed woman. Mr Alkant is survived by his parents, three sisters and two brothers. He was laid to rest last Saturday at the Nasarat Cemetery.
