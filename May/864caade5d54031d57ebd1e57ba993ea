The violence seems to have dissipated for now, after MEC for Public Works, Roads and Transport, Ms Mohita Latchminarain, threatened both the Nasaret District Taxi Association and the Middelburg District Taxi association with suspension of operational licenses. She temporarily suspended operating licenses, providing alternative transport services for affected commuters. The MEC has appointed Thembalethu Bus Services for the safe transportation of Extension 24 and Rockdale residents. The appointment of the bus service was announced on Tuesday. The buses will be stationed near the Middelburg Police Station to ensure no vigilante attacks on the transport service occurs. The large contingent of police and traffic officers around Nasaret have also been deployed to protect buses in transit.
