Mpumalanga Department of Public Works, Roads and Transport MEC Mohita Latchminarain reinstated the two associations’ operating licenses on May 24, after intense discussions between public works officials and executive committee members from the associations. The associations signed a memorandum of agreement detailing that they will both operate in the Extension 24 and Rockdale route for 21 days while the department conducts investigations. The associations also agreed to participate in a mediation process facilitated by senior council members, to resolve the dispute. On Tuesday, the Middelburg Observer spoke to David Ross from the NDTA, who said no violent incidents have been reported as of yet. Over a month ago, MEC Mohita Latchminarain revoked the two associations’ permits after ongoing violence over the Extension 24 and Rockdale route.
