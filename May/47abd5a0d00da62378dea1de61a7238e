Voter turnout was dismal at 25.73% with only 891 out of 3463 registered voters casting ballots. Of the 891 votes, 7 were spoilt, resulting in 884 votes counted. The ANC’s Cacious Sihle Mashiloane received 589 votes (66.63%), with the Middelburg and Hendrina Residents Front giving the EFF a knockout at all voting stations. The MHRF’s Jomo Segage received 184 votes (20.81%) compared to the EFF’s Lerato Pearl Mapengu’s 111 nods (12.56%). Late Councilor Patrick Motau’s wife, Monga, congratulated Mashiloane with the convincing win. MHRF General Secretary and former ANC mayor, Mr Ben Mokoena, said he was proud of the results, as the front was only established six months ago. He says he believes the party would have done better, had the voter turnout been higher.
