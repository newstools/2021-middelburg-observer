The store manager at The Fix, told www.mobserver.co.za, that staff members were held at gunpoint by two men, who made off with cellphones and cash during an in-and-out robbery. The store did not have any visiting customers at the time, and no injuries were caused during the robbery. According to an anonymous bystander, they were visiting a restaurant when they heard screams. The assailants fled the scene at entrance four of the mall, near the Wimpy restaurant. Www.mobserver.co.za contacted the mall’s operational manager, who declined to comment until the investigation has been completed. The robbery follows short on the heels of another incident, which occurred at the Media Store two weeks ago. The store was also held by armed men who fired shots during their raid.
