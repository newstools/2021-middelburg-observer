Titon Security and SAPS responded to a complaint at a home occupied by a number of women, claiming to be students. Residents of the area say that while the home is being rented out as student accommodation, a lot of men frequent the house on a daily basis. According to neighbours, a woman screamed for help between 06:00 and 07:00 this morning. Titon Security responded to the emergency call and found a man inside the house. He had a gas pistol with him with which he allegedly threatened the victim. He then allegedly raped her numerous times throughout the night. After falling asleep, the woman raised the alarm. Titon reaction officer Chris van der Walt subdued the suspect until police arrived and arrested him for alleged rape. The gas pistol was found inside the manâ€™s car outside the home. The car is fitted with a Gauteng registration number.
