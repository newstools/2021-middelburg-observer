People jumping from taxi’s and bakkies with pangas, baseball bats and metal sticks, attacking other taxis, were seen in different parts of Cowen Ntuli Street in the CBD between 11:00 and 12:00 today.  The taxis were attacked while it were still full of passengers in a “hit and run” fashion. Passengers jumped out and fled in terror.  According to bystanders this taxi “war” in town was between the Middelburg District Taxi Association (MDTA) and Nasaret District Association.  Doctor Silinda of the NDTA said that the association is at its wit’s end with MDTA taxis “illegally” operating on the Extension 24 and Rockdale routes. He said that they hired a security company from KwaZulu Natal to contain the situation.
