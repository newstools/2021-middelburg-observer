Ms Simelane is in the running for mayor, after the vacancy was declared with the passing of Mayor Bagudi Tolo on February 2. Council veteran and long running Mayoral Committee Member for Community Safety, Cllr Diphale Motsepe, has also made the shortlist alongside former councilor and Mayoral Committee Member under Mayor Mike Masina, Mr Philile Nkosi. Mr Nkosi had at times acted as mayor when Mr Masina was out of office. The decision now rests with the provincial executive of the ANC. A council sitting to confirm the new mayor could be held as soon as Tuesday. Council only has 21 days to fill the position.     * Notice: Coronavirus reporting at Caxton Local Media aims to combat fake news Dear reader, As your local news provider, we have the duty of keeping you factually informed on Covid-19 developments.
